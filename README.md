### About

The RQuantLib package makes parts of
[QuantLib](https://github.com/lballabio/quantlib) visible to the R
user. Currently a number option pricing functions are included, both
vanilla and exotic, as well as a broad range of fixed-income
functions. Also included are general calendaring and holiday
utilities. Further software contributions are welcome.

The QuantLib project aims to provide a comprehensive software framework for
quantitative finance. The goal is to provide a standard open source library
for quantitative analysis, modeling, trading, and risk management of
financial assets.

### Status

The package is actively maintained, and is still being
extended. Contributions are welcome, and initial discussions via
[GitHub issue tickets](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rquantlib/issues)
are encouraged as suggested in the
[Contributing guide](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/rquantlib/blob/master/Contributing.md).

### Installation 

#### From Source
